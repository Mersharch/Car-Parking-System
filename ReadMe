An arduino managed autonomous car park management system.
This system helps reduce traffic at a parking lot, it displays the available(empty and filled) spots.
Vehicles are only allowed entry if there is available parking space and denied entry if there isn't.
Before entering the lcd displays exactly which spots are empty so the Vehicles know where they are going to.
